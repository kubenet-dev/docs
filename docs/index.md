Welcome to `kubenet`, a community based approach to help network engineers better understand the potential of kubernetes for network automation. 

The environment is setup such that can leverage multiple vendors. We use [srlinux][srlinux] for now as this is open to use, but we would welcome other vendors.

## Join us

Join us on this journey as we learn how to leverage kubernetes for network automation.
